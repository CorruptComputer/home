    <Box Title="Hello there!">
        <p>
            I started programming in High School, and have had a passion for it ever since. 
            The first language I ever used was Java and it will always have a soft spot in my heart, however since then I have learned and grown to love many other languages such as C#, C++, Python, and JavaScript. 
            The best thing to me about being a Software Developer is the constant need to learn and hone your skills with how quickly new technologies and best practices are released.
            <br />
            <br /> Some qualities for developing software that I think are important:
            <br /> Write readable code: if no one can read the code and edit it that does nothing but hurt everyone in the long run.
            <br /> Documentation is just as important as code: if you write some awesome piece of software and no one knows how to use it, then its not a useful one.
            <br /> Always improve and learn: this field moves so quickly compared to others, if you are not constantly learning you'll end up getting left behind.
            <br />
            <br /> Below you will find some more information about me and what I am currently doing.
