    <Box Title="Nim">
        <p>
            Nim is a mathematical game of strategy, which is based on the ancient Chineese board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nim</a>.
            In !Nim players take turns removing coins from heaps, and the player who takes the last coin on the board wins!

        <p>
            A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a space into regions based on distance to points in the space.
            This is a simple implementation of a Voronoi diagram.
